ARLES BAKERY.

Baking and coffee-making are arts that have transcended over the years. Both have a rich history of preparation methods, cultivation processes, decorations, and much more. As a result, countless variants have emerged, each representing a specific place or person.

Because of this, the purpose of the code is to help coffee and bread enthusiasts keep track of all the coffees and breads they have tried. It also allows users to save recipes. In this way, users will have detailed information and complete recipes for the coffees and breads they have tasted.

In the code, the user will need to enter the name of the item, size, purchase price, and recipe URL. Additionally, within the item class, the user will define a flavor rating from 1-10.
